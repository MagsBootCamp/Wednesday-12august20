    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Josh is an emerging artist from Adelaide South Australia. His music is written about life - coming straight from the heart and it's uniquely authentic. The diversity of his early influences in addition to those he has found later in life have shaped the type of music that he composes. In particular the virtuosic guitar playing of Ben Howard, John Martyn and Nick Drake, as well as the compositional approaches from Radiohead and Talk Talk have greatly influenced his sound.</p>
